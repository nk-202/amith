# Attendance Email Notification System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### **Automatic Email Notifications for Attendance**

When a faculty member marks a student as **Present** or **Absent**, the system automatically sends a beautifully formatted email to the student's registered email address.

---

## 🔧 **Components Created**

### 1. **Email Service** (`server/services/emailService.js`)
- Uses **Brevo (Sendinblue)** API for reliable email delivery
- Beautiful HTML email templates with:
  - **Present**: Green theme with ✅ icon and encouraging message
  - **Absent**: Red theme with ❌ icon and warning message
- Includes all attendance details:
  - Subject name
  - Date (formatted beautifully)
  - Faculty who marked attendance
  - Status (Present/Absent)

### 2. **Updated Attendance Routes** (`server/routes/attendance.js`)
- **Single Attendance**: `/api/attendance/mark`
  - Marks attendance for one student
  - Sends email if `send_notification` is true
  
- **Bulk Attendance**: `/api/attendance/mark-bulk`
  - Marks attendance for multiple students
  - Sends emails to all if `send_notifications` is true
  - Returns count of emails sent

### 3. **Environment Configuration** (`.env`)
- Added Brevo API credentials:
  ```
  BREVO_API_KEY=xkeysib-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@sietcse.edu
  BREVO_SENDER_NAME=SIET CSE Department
  ```

## 📧 **Email Template Features**

### **For PRESENT Status:**
- ✅ Green success theme
- Encouraging message: "Great! Keep up the good attendance record"
- Professional layout with SIET branding

### **For ABSENT Status:**
- ❌ Red warning theme
- Important notice: "Please ensure regular attendance"
- Reminder to submit documentation if absent for valid reasons

### **Both Include:**
- Student name
- Subject name
- Date (formatted as "Monday, February 4, 2026")
- Faculty who marked attendance
- Professional footer with copyright
- Responsive design (works on mobile and desktop)

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **When Faculty Marks Attendance:**

1. **Faculty opens Attendance page** (Staff → Attendance)
2. **Selects students** and marks them Present/Absent
3. **Enables "Send Notification"** checkbox (optional)
4. **Clicks "Save Attendance"**

### **Backend Process:**

1. ✅ **Saves attendance** to database
2. 📧 **Fetches student email** from User model
3. 👨‍🏫 **Fetches faculty name** from Faculty model
4. 📚 **Fetches subject** from Timetable model
5. 📨 **Sends email** via Brevo API
6. ✅ **Logs success** or handles errors gracefully

### **Student Receives:**

- **Professional email** in their inbox
- **Clear status** (Present/Absent)
- **All relevant details** (subject, date, faculty)
- **Actionable advice** based on status

---

## 🔐 **Security & Reliability**

- **API Key secured** in environment variables
- **Error handling**: Attendance marking succeeds even if email fails
- **Graceful degradation**: Skips email if student email not found
- **Detailed logging**: All email operations logged for debugging

## 📊 **API Endpoints**

### **Mark Single Attendance**
```
POST /api/attendance/mark

}
```

### **Mark Bulk Attendance**
```

    { student_id, date, status, timetable_id, class_id }
  ],

}
Response: {
  message: "Bulk attendance marked",
  results: {
    success: 25,
    failed: 0,
    emailsSent: 25
  }
}
```

## 🎯 **Testing**

To test the email system:

1. **Ensure student has email** during enrollment
2. **Mark attendance** with "Send Notification" enabled
3. **Check student's email inbox**
4. **Check backend logs** for email status

### **Backend Logs Will Show:**
```
📝 Marking attendance: { student_id: '...', status: 'present', ... }
✅ Attendance email sent to: student@example.com
✅ Attendance email sent successfully: { to: '...', messageId: '...' }
```
